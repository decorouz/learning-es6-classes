# learning-es6-classes

Learning about es6 classes and how they are better at implementing inheritance compared to prototypical inheritance

The second lecture talks about hoisting. Which is basiclly moving function to the top of the code at run time.
Hoisting also explain a critical different between function Declaration and Expression in JS.
Function Declaration are hoisted. Which means they are raised to the top of the code.

In constracts, function expressions are not hoisted.

However, it important to note here that Class Declarations are NOT HOISTED.

# STATIC METHOD

We have both the instance method and static method.

The static method are useful at creating utility functions. Just like we have Math utility functions that are not tied to a particular object.
